# (~~Final~~) Destination

The purpose is to share our projects ideas to stop code solo and move faster.


# Shoot (~~me again~~) fresh idea

- Create a repo
- Write in the README the main goal of your project. No need of code line at this step.
- When collaborators are found, write as fast as possible a Proof Of Concept.

# Finding (~~Carter~~) Collaborators

On Discord, reach the "Tek Tech" server and ask for a text channel.
